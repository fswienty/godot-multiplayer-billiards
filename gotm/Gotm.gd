# Official GDScript API for games on gotm.io
# This plugin serves as a polyfill while developing against the API locally.

# The 'real' API calls are only available when running the game live on gotm.io. 
# Running the game in the web player (gotm.io/web-player) also counts as live.

# Add this script as a global autoload. Make sure the global autoload is named 
# "Gotm". It must be named "Gotm" for it to work.
